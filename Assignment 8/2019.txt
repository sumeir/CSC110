I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to heal
Somebody to know
Somebody to have
Somebody to hold
It's easy to say
But it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know
Somebody to heal
Somebody to have
Just to know how it feels
It's easy to say but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
Now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around
For now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds
Into nightfall
And you're not here
To get me through it all
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down
And then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for you
Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat dripping off me
Before I even knew her name, la la la
It felt like ooh la la la

Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Tequila sunrise
Her body fit right in my hands, la la la
It felt like ooh la la la, yeah

I wish I could pretend I didn't need you
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running

I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave you
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la
Ooh, I should be running
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
Locked in the hotel
There's just some things that never change
You say we're just friends
But friends don't know the way you taste, la la la
'Cause you know it's been a long time coming
Don't you let me fall
Ooh, when your lips undress me
Hooked on your tongue
Ooh love, your kiss is deadly
Don't stop
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need you
But every touch is ooh la la la
It's true, la la la

We couldn't turn around
'Til we were upside down
I'll be the bad guy now
But no, I ain't too proud
I couldn't be there
Even when I try
You don't believe it
We do this every time
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again
So I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away
Let go
I got a feeling that it's time to let go
I say so
I knew that this was doomed from the get-go
You thought that it was special, special
But it was just the sex though, the sex though
And I still hear the echoes (the echoes)
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go
Let it go
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again
So I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away
Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
It's only me, what you got to lose?
Make up your mind, tell me, what are you gonna do?
It's only me, let it go
Seasons change and our love went cold
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let go
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away
I dare you to do something
I'm waiting on you again
So I don't take the blame
Run away, but we're running in circles
Run away, run away, run away

Me and Kurt feel the same, too much pleasure is pain
My girl spites me in vain, all I do is complain
She need something to change, need to take off the edge
So fuck it all tonight
And don't tell me to shut up
When you know you talk too much
But you don't got shit to say
I want you out of my head
I want you out of my bedroom tonight (bedroom)
There's no way I can save you (save you)
'Cause I need to be saved, too
I'm no good at goodbyes
We're both acting insane but too stubborn to change
Now I'm drinking again, 80 proof in my veins
And my fingertip stained, looking over the edge
Don't fuck with me tonight
Say you needed this heart and you got it (got it)
Turns out that it wasn't what you wanted (wanted)
And we wouldn't let go and we lost it (lost it)
Now I'm a goner
I want you out of my head (head)
I want you out of my bedroom tonight (bedroom)
There's no way I can save you (save you)
'Cause I need to be saved, too (saved, too)
I'm no good at goodbyes
I want you out of my life
I want you back here tonight
I'm tryna cut you, no knife
I wanna slice you and dice you
My heart get possessive, it got you precise
Can you not turn off the TV? I'm watching the fight
I flood the garage, blue diamond, no shark
You're Barbie life doll, it's Nicki Minaj
You don't need a key to drive, your car on the charger
I just wanna see the side, the one that's unbothered (yeah)
And I don't want you to never go outside (outside)
I promise if they play, my niggas sliding (sliding)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I want you out of my head (head)

There's no way I could save you (save you)
'Cause I need to be saved, too (saved, too)

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
I'm no good at goodbyes
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
I'm no good at goodbyes

We are, we are, we are
L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sundown and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're heading downtown
('Round here) everybody's looking for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out
We don't fit in well
'Cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help
Getting out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear
So don't ask that question here
This is my only fear, that we become
Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" And, "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party
That's not who we are
(We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful
Yeah, that's not who we are
(We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful
L.A. mm
Drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere (nowhere, nowhere)
I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there (all night)
I'm not fazed by all them lights and flashing cameras (uh)
'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care
We don't fit in well
We are just ourselves
I could use some help
Getting out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear
So don't ask that question here
This is my only fear, that we become
Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" And "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone

We are not beautiful, yeah
Yeah, that's not who we are
(We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful
We are, we are, we are
We are not beautiful

I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie
Wondering if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even looking me in my eyes
Then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, "Shall we dance?" Hell, yeah
You know I love you, did I ever tell you?
You make it better like that
Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, yeah
I always feel like I'm nobody, mm
Who wants to fit in anyway?
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause I don't care, as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
We at a party we don't wanna be at
Tryna talk, but we can't hear ourselves
Read your lips, I'd rather kiss 'em right back
With all these people all around
I'm crippled with anxiety
But I'm told it's where I'm supposed to be
You know what? It's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind
And you make it better like that
Don't think we fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, oh yeah, yeah
When we walked in, I said I'm sorry, mm
But now I think that we should stay
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
Yeah, you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (no)
I don't like nobody but you
It's like you're the only one here
I don't like nobody but you
Baby, I don't care
I don't like nobody but you
I hate everyone here
I don't like nobody but you
Baby, yeah
'Cause I don't care (don't care) when I'm with my baby, yeah (oh yeah)
All the bad things disappear (disappear)
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody (maybe I'm somebody)

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

I've been having dreams
Jumping on a trampoline
Flipping in the air
I never land, just float there
As I'm looking up
Suddenly the sky erupts
Flames alight the trees
Spread to falling leaves
Now they're right upon me
Wait if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved
I've been having dreams
Splashing in a summer stream
Trip and I fall in
I wanted it to happen
My body turns to ice
Crushing weight of paradise
Solid block of gold
Lying in the cold
I feel right at home
Wait if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved
Wait if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved
I never feel so loved
Wait if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved
Wait if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved

White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleeping, you're on your tippy toes
Creeping around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises, on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm the bad guy
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at being bad, bad
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne
I'm a bad guy
I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad-

I'm done hating myself for feeling
I'm done crying myself awake
I've gotta leave and start the healing
But when you move like that, I just want to stay
What have I become?
Looking through your phone now, oh, now
Love to you is just a game
Look what I've done
Dialing up the numbers on you
I don't want my heart to break
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that shame and all that danger
I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that fear and all that pressure
I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight
Love will keep you up tonight
(Tell me how do you)
Oh no, how did I manage to lose me?
I am not this desperate, not this crazy
There's no way I'm sticking 'round to find out
I won't lose like that, I won't lose myself
Look what I've done now
Dialing up the numbers on you
I don't want my heart to break
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that shame and all that danger
I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that fear and all that pressure
I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Love will keep you up tonight
(Tell me how do you)
Oh
Love will keep you up tonight
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
All that shame and all that danger
I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me? (oh)
All that fear and all that pressure
I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight
(Tell me how do you)

Feeling good as hell
Hair toss
Check my nails
Baby how you feeling?
Feeling good as hell
Woo child, tired of the bullshit
Go on dust your shoulders off, keep it moving
Yes Lord, tryna get some new shit
In there, swimwear, going to the pool shit
Come now, come dry your eyes
You know you a star, you can touch the sky
I know that it's hard but you have to try
If you need advice, let me simplify
If he don't love you anymore
Just walk your fine ass out the door
I do my hair toss
Check my nails
Baby how you feeling?
Feeling good as hell
Hair toss
Check my nails
Baby how you feeling?
Feeling good as hell
Feeling good as hell
Baby how you feeling?
Feeling good as hell
Woo girl, need to kick off your shoes

Even if we both break down tonight
And you say you hate me
And we go to bed angry
I know everything will be alright
I'll be here waiting
I promise I'm changing
I just need
A little time to show you I'm worth it
I know that I can be a difficult person
I'm a stress case drive you up the wall when I'm working
Actually I'm prolly worse when I'm not you don't deserve it
Make you nervous 'cause you know I'ma break soon
Every time I do I say something that hurts you
Acting like I'm gone, but we both in the same room
I don't like to be wrong which I know you relate to
And I know I make you feel like you're at the end of your road
That's when I look at you and tell you I'd be better alone
That's just the pride talking isn't it cause both of us know
I'm the definition of wreck if you look into my soul
Comes out the most
When I feel I'm in a vulnerable place
Made a lot of mistakes
I wish I knew how to erase
When I'm afraid
Might get distant, and I push you away
But no matter the case
I'ma do whatever it takes
Even if
Even if we both break down tonight
And you say you hate me
And we go to bed angry
I know everything will be alright
I'll be here waiting
I promise I'm changing
I just need time
I, I need time
I just need time
I, I need time
Time, time
Yeah
Way before I bought you the ring
We were fighting back and forth like you were wearing the thing
Two passionate people not afraid to say what they think
Lead to passionate conversation when it's hard to agree
You know me well sitting on the edge of my seat
Looking at life over analyzing everything
Always depressed trying to find a better version of me
Searching for something I knows prolly right in front of my feet
Stubborn as me?
Maybe not but you're close to it
Got a lot of issues I'm tryna work through 'em
Going to therapy for you's something that's worth doing
When I know you been there for me through all of my worst moments
And I know it hurts knowing that I carry this weight on my chest
Making it difficult for me to open up and connect
A lot of regrets
I apologize for all of the stress
That's not what I meant
To do
You know I love you to death
Even if
Even if we both break down tonight
And you say you hate me
And we go to bed angry
I know everything will be alright
I'll be here waiting
I promise I'm changing
I just need time
I, I need time
I just need time
I, I need time
Time, time
I just need time
I, I need time
