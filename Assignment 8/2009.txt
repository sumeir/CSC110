You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare
I'd like to make myself believe that planet earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems
'Cause I'd get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread (thread thread)
I'd like to make myself believe that planet earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)
Leave my door open just a crack
Please take me away from here
'Cause I feel like such an insomniac
Please take me away from here
Why do I tire of counting sheep
Please take me away from here
When I'm far too tired to fall asleep
To ten million fireflies
I'm weird cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell (said farewell)
But I'll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
'Cause I saved a few and I keep them in a jar (jar jar)
I'd like to make myself believe that planet earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)
I'd like to make myself believe that planet earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)

Turn the lights on
Every night I rush to my bed
With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you when I close my eyes
I'm going out of my head
Lost in a fairytale; can you hold my hands and be my guide
Clouds filled with stars cover your skies
And I hope it rains
You're the perfect lullaby
What kinda dream is this?
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you (turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me--your love's too good to be true (turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure--I ain't going nowhere
Baby 'long as you're here I'll be floating on air 'cause you're my
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you (turn the lights on)
I mention you when I say my prayers
I wrap you around all of my thoughts
Boy you're my temporary high
I wish that when I wake up you're there
To wrap your arms around me for real
And tell me you'll stay by my side
Clouds filled with stars cover the skies
And I hope it rains; you're the perfect lullaby
What kinda dream is this?
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you (turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me--your love's too good to be true (turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure--I ain't going nowhere
Baby 'long as you're here I'll be floating on air 'cause you're my
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you (turn the lights on)
Tattoo your name across my heart
So it will remain
Not even death can make us part
What kind of dream is this?
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you (turn the lights on)
Sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Somebody pinch me--your love's too good to be true (turn the lights on)
My guilty pleasure--I ain't going nowhere
Baby 'long as you're here I'll be floating on air 'cause you're my
You can be a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you (turn the lights on)
Either way I don't wanna wake up from you

You're on the phone with your girlfriend
She's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room
It's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do'
But she wears short skirts
I wear T-shirts
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up
And find that what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you can see I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me
You belong with me
Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
Hey isn't this easy
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say your fine
I know you better then that
Hey what you doing with a girl like that
She wears high heels
I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up
And find that what what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you can see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know
Baby you belong with me
You belong with me
Oh I remember you driving to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're about to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
I think I know where you belong
I think I know it's with me
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time
How could you not know
Baby you belong with me
You belong with me
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me

Catch me in the kitchen like a Simmons wipping pastry's
Cruising down 8th St. off white Lexus
Driving so slow but BK is from Texas
Me I'm out that Bed-Stuy home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say whattup to Ty-Ty still sipping Mai Tai's
Sitting courtside Knicks and Nets give me high five
Nigga I be Spike'd out I could trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely from
In New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York New York New York
Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Shit I made the Yankee hat more famous then a Yankee can
You should know I bleed blue but I ain't a Crip though
But I got a gang of niggas walking with my clique though
Welcome to the melting pot corners where we selling rock
Afrika Bambataa shit home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab gypsy cab dollar cab holla back
For foreigners it ain't for they act like they forgot how to act
Eight million stories out there in it naked
City is a pity half of y'all won't make it
Me I got a plug Special Ed "I Got It Made"
If Jesus paying Lebron I'm paying Dwyane Wade
Three dice cee-lo three card monte
Labor Day Parade rest in peace Bob Marley
Statue of Liberty long live the World Trade
Long live the King yo I'm from the Empire St. that's
In New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York New York New York
Lights is blinding girls need blinders
So they can step out of bounds quick the sidelines is
Lined with casualties who sip to life casually
Then gradually become worse don't bite the apple Eve
Caught up in the in-crowd now you're in style
End of the winter gets cold en vogue with your skin out
City of sin it's a pity on the whim
Good girls gone bad the city's filled with them
Mommy took a bus trip now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her just like a bus route
Hail Mary to the city you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you life starts when the church end
Came here for school graduated to the high life
Ball players rap stars addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feeling like a champion
The city never sleeps better slip you an Ambien
In New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York New York New York
One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights big dreams all looking pretty
No place in the world that could compare
Put your lighters in the air everybody say yeah yeah
Yea yea
In New York
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Let's hear it for New York New York New York

It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne ever mayne ever mayne
I'm shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne ever mayne ever mayne
Last name ever
First name greatest
Like a sprained ankle boy ain't nothing to play with
It started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis
In your city faded off the brown Nino
She insists she got more class we know!
Swimming in the money come and find me Nemo
If I was at the club you know I balled chemo
Dropped the mixtape that shit sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name beside the X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal I did it without one
Yeah nigga I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it at least you got to witness
Bitches
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne ever mayne ever mayne
I'm shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne ever mayne ever mayne
Forever ever Mr. West is in da building
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams
Big fame big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
I went hard all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story my glory
I had raped the game young
You can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they can build statures of me
Old money Benjamin Button what nothin'
Now superbad chicks giving me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas would know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me no you fucking wasn't
You're such a fucking loser
He didn't even go to class Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull their cameras out and God damn they snap
I used to want this thing forever y'all can have it back
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne ever mayne ever mayne
I'm shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne ever mayne ever mayne
OK hello it's the martian Space Jam Jordan's
I want this shit forever wake up and smell the Garden
Fresher than the harvest
Step up to the target
If I had one guess than I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops
Hopped up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for this is my theme park
My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention
Lil Wayne that's what they got to say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover
Shh my foot's sleeping on the gas
No brake pads no such thing as last
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne ever mayne ever mayne
I'm shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne ever mayne ever mayne
There they go packing stadiums
As Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go macadamian they go so ballistic wow
We can make them look like bozos
He's wondering if he should spit this slow
Fuck no go for broke
His cup just runneth over oh no
He ain't had a buzz like this since the last time he overdosed
They've been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be the same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing a name as he goes
The passion and the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck I'm talking about when we riot
You dealin' with a few true villains
Whose staying inside of the booth truth spillin'
And spit true feelings
Til our tooth fillings come flying up out of our mouths now rewind it
Payback muthafucka for the way you got at me so hows it taste?
When I slap the taste out your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter so just in case you're thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place so Drake
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever mayne ever mayne ever mayne
I'm shutting shit down at the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever mayne ever mayne ever mayne

I've been roaming around
Always looking down at all I see
Painted faces fill the places I can't reach
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you and all you know and how you speak
Countless lovers under cover of the street
You know that I could use somebody
You know that I could use somebody
Someone like you
Off in the night while you live it up I'm off to sleep
Waging wars to shape the poet and the beat
I hope it's gonna make you notice
I hope it's gonna make you notice
Someone like me
Someone like me
Someone like me somebody
Someone like you somebody
Someone like you somebody
Someone like you somebody
I've been roaming around
Always looking down at all I see
