Man it's a hot one
Like seven inches from the midday sun
Well I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone
But you stay so cool
My mu√±equita my Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason
The step in my groove
And if you said this life aingt good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth
And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Oh it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth yeah
Give me your heart make it real or else forget about it
But I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it'd be a crying shame
In every breath and every word
I hear your name calling me out
Out from the barrio
You hear my rhythm on your radio
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
It's turning you round and round
And if you said this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
Because you're so smooth
Well and it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth yeah
Give me your heart make it real or else forget about it
Well and it's just like the ocean under the moon
Oh it's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth yeah
Give me your heart make it real or else forget about it
Or else forget about it
Or else forget about it
Oh let's don't forget about it
Give me your heart make it real
Let's don't forget about it (hey)
Let's don't forget about it (no oh no oh)
Let's don't forget about it (no no no oh)
Let's don't forget about it (hey no no oh)
Let's don't forget about it (hey hey hey)

All I want is somebody who's gonna love me for me
Somebody I can love for them
All this money don't mean shit
If you ain't got nobody to share it with
Love rules the world you feel me
He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you
When it hurt I ease the pain girl caress your frame
Get them worries off your brain girl I'm in your corner
Do what you want it's your thing girl I persist and try but
We one in the same girl it ain't a game
So I can't play with you I wanna lay with you
Stay with you pray with you grow old and gray with you
In good and bad times we'll always make it through
Cause what we got is true no matter what they say to you
I could straight lace you not just appearance
Stimulate your mind strengthen your spirits
Be that voice of reason when you ain't tryna hear it
You want it but you fear it but you love it when you near it
Sit her on the sofa get a little closer
Touch you right do it like a man's suppose to
Knew you was the one that's why I chose you
Cause you get down for yours and ride like a soldier
He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you
Your soul ain't a toy you ain't dealing with a boy
Feel emptiness inside? I can fill that void
When you spend time with your woman and listen
It shines more than any bagguette diamond can glisten
I can't impress you with the cars and the wealth
Cause any woman with will and drive can get it herself
I'd rather show you it's heartfelt make your heart melt
And prove to you you're more important than anything else
Worthwhile special like my first child
When I see your face it's always like the first time
Our eyes met I knew we'd be together in a tri-jet
I wanna give you things that I didn't buy yet
Hold you mold you don't know let me show you
Ain't no telling what we could grow to
Let it be known I told you
And I'mma be there for whatever you go through my love's true
He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you
Don't let him sing you a sad song No baby
Waiting for love like this too long
You don't have to wait you don't have to wait on him baby
All that you need I can give you
You don't have to wait you don't have to wait on
I do satisfy you
You don't have to wait on him
I'm the light when you can't see
I'm that air when you can't breathe
I'm that feeling when you can't leave
Some doubt some believe some lie cheat and deceive
So it's only you and me
When you weak I'll make you strong here's where you belong
I ain't perfect but I promise I won't do you wrong
Keep you away from harm my love is protected
I'll wrap you in my arms so you'll never feel neglected
I'll just make you aware of what we have is rare
In the moment of despair I'm the courage when you're scared
Loyal down for you soon as I saw you
Wanted to be there cause I could hold it down for you
Be around for you plant seeds in the soil
Make love all night bending bed coils
You're a queen therefore I treat you royal
This is all for you cause I simply adore you
He don't understand you like I do
No he'll never make love to you like I do
So give it to me
Cause I can show you 'bout a real love
And I can promise anything that I do
Is just to satisfy you
This one right here goes out to all my sisters

Give me your love

Uh huh
Escape
Boy your love's so good
I don't want to let go
And although I should
I can't leave you alone
'Cause you're so disarming
I'm caught up in the midst of you
And I can not resist and oh
Boy if I do
The things you want me to
The way I used to do
Would you love me baby
Hold me feeling now
Go and break my heart
Heartbreaker you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly

Persuade me to relinquish my love to you
But I can not resist at all
Boy if I do
The things you want me to
The way I used to do
Would you love me baby
Hold me feeling now
Go and break my heart
Heartbreaker you got the best of me

She want to pillow fight in the middle of the night
She want to drive my Benz with five of her friends
She want to creep past the block spying again
She want to roll with Jay chase the skeeos away
She want to fight with lame chicks blow my day
She want to inspect the rest kick me to the curb

So I creep yeah 'cause he doesn't know what I do

If tomorrow is judgment day
And I'm standing on the front line
And the Lord asks me what I did with my life
I will say I spent it with you
If I wake up in World War III
I see destruction and poverty
And I feel like I want to go home
It's okay if you're coming with me
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
If I lose my fame and fortune (really don't matter)
And I'm homeless on the street (on the street Lord)
And I'm sleeping in Grand Central Station (okay)
It's okay if you're sleeping with me
As the years they pass us by (the years the years the years the years the years)
We stay young through each other's eyes (each other's eyes)
And no matter how old we get
It's okay as long as I got you baby
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
If I should die this very day (very very very day)
Don't cry (don't cry) 'cause on Earth we weren't meant to stay
And no matter what the people say (really don't matter)
I'll be waiting for you after the judgment day
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us

It's undeniable
That we should be together
It's unbelievable
How I used to say
That I'd fall never
The basis is need to know
If you don't know
Just how I feel
Then let me show you now
That I'm for real
If all things in time
Time will reveal
One
You're like a dream come true
Two
Just want to be with you
Three
Girl it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me
And four
Repeat steps one through three
Five
Make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I'll start back at one
It's so incredible
The way things work themselves out
And all emotional
Once you know what it's all about hey
And undesirable
For us to be apart
I never would have made it very far
'Cause you know you've got the keys to my heart
One
You're like a dream come true
Two
Just want to be with you
Three
Girl it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me
And four
Repeat steps one through three
Five
Make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I'll start back at one
Say farewell to the dark of night
I see the coming of the sun
I feel like a little child
Whose life has just begun
You came and breathed new life
Into this lonely heart of mine
You threw out of the lifeline
Just in the nick of time
One
You're like a dream come true
Two
Just want to be with you
Three
Girl it's plain to see
That you're the only one for me
And four
Repeat steps one through three
Five
Make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done
Then I'll start back at one

To just act like we never were
To come around and not show hurt
How dare we greet by shaking hands
Just months ago I was your man (was your man)
Verbally we'd agreed it was over
And we were though
I'm to compose myself but I just
Can't get over you girl (oh oh oh)
We can't be friends
(yeah oh no)
We can't be friends
(Deborah you know I can't go on being just your friend yeah)
Cause I'm still in love with you
I went by mother's saw your car there
To her you still family and it don't seem fair
For everyone to just go on
I've tried and I can't do it
Cause I'm still torn
I tried to think of you as just another love
(in my past) in my past that didn't last
But it's not that simple baby we
We can't be friends
(oh no no no no no) we
We can't be friends
(if we) if we can't be lovers
(we we we)
We can't be friends
Cause I'm still in love
You may see me staring
Or catch me in a daze
You may see me hang my head
When yo come me way
Don't get to close to me
And expect to behave(behave)
I might just steal a kiss
If you come near my face
What I'm trying to say (say)
We can't be friends
(yeah oh no)
We can't be friends
(Deborah you know I can't go on being just your friend yeah)
Cause I'm still in love with you
We can't be friends
Can you look me in the eyes
And honestly say you don't love me?
All that I know
I'll never ever find another love like you oh no
I love you too much baby
I love you much oh
We can't be friends I'm still in love
With you
With you
I am
Still in love
Still in love
You didn't have to leave
With you

I was lying on the grass of Sunday morning of last week
Indulging in my self-defeat
My mind was thugged all laced and bugged all twisted wrong and beat
A comfortable three feet deep
Now the fuzzy stare from not being there on a confusing morning week
Impaired my tribal lunar speak
And of course you can't become if you only say what you would have done
So I missed a million miles of fun
I know it's up for me
(If you steal my sunshine)
Making sure I'm not in too deep
(If you steal my sunshine)
Keeping versed and on my feet
(If you steal my sunshine)
I was frying on the bench slide in the park across the street
L-A-T-E-R that week
My sticky paws were into making straws out of big fat slurpy treats
An incredible eight-foot heap
Now the funny glare to pay a gleaming tare in a staring under heat
Involved an under usual feat
And I'm not only among but I invite who I want to come
So I missed a million miles of fun
I know it's up for me
(If you steal my sunshine)
Making sure I'm not in too deep
(If you steal my sunshine)
Keeping versed and on my feet
(If you steal my sunshine)
I know it's done for me
(If you steal my sunshine)
Not some and hard to see
(If you steal my sunshine)
Keeping dumb and built to beat
(If you steal my sunshine)
My sunshine if you steal my sunshine
My sunshine if you steal my sunshine
My sunshine if you steal my sunshine
My sunshine if you steal my sunshine
My sunshine if you steal my sunshine
My sunshine if you steal my sunshine
My sunshine if you steal my sunshine
My sunshine if you steal my sunshine
My sunshine if you steal my sunshine

Someday when my life has passed me by
I'll lay around and wonder why you were always there for me
One way in the eyes of a passer by
I'll look around for another try and fade away
Just close your eyes and I'll take you there
This place is warm and without a care
We'll take a swim in the deep blue sea
I go to leave and you reach for me
Some say better things will come our way
No matter what they try to say you were always there for me
Some way when the sun begins to shine
I hear a song from another time and fade away
And fade away
Just close your eyes and I'll take you there
This place is warm and without a care
We'll take a swim in the deep blue sea
I go to leave and you reach for me
Oh come on
Someone said you tried to long (you will pass me by)
Someone said we got it all wrong (all wrong)
Someone said we tried to long (you will pass me by)
Every thinks were right belong
So far so long so far away
So far so wrong so far away away away
Someday when my life has passed me by
I'll lay around and wonder why you were always there for me
One way in the eyes of a passer by
I'll look around for another try and fade away
And fade away
And fade away
And fade away
And fade away
And fade away
And fade away
And fade away
And fade away
And fade away

Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you 'cause
With the birds I'll share
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewing
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewing
Push me up against the wall
Young Kentucky girl in a push-up bra
Falling all over myself
To lick your heart and taste your health 'cause
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewing
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewing
With the birds I'll share this lonely view
Blood loss in a bathroom stall
A southern girl with a scarlet drawl
Wave goodbye to ma and pa
'Cause with the birds I'll share
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewing
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewing
Soft spoken with a broken jaw
Step outside but not to brawl and
Autumn's sweet we call it fall
I'll make it to the moon if I have to crawl and
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewing
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewing
With the birds I'll share this lonely view
Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you 'cause
With the birds I'll share
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewing
With the birds I'll share this lonely viewing
With the birds I'll share this lonely view

For a century of lonely nights
Waiting for someone to release me
You're licking your lips
And blowing kisses my way
But that don't mean I'm gonna give it away
Baby baby baby (Baby baby baby)
Ooh my body's saying let's go

If you wanna be with me
Baby there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle (In a bottle baby)
You gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me (If you wanna be with me)
I can make your wish come true
Just come and set me free baby
And I'll be with you
I'm a genie in a bottle baby
Come come come on and let me out
